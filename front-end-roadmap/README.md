### Style your pages with CSS

With the help of HTML, you create structure for your pages. CSS allows you to style your pages and make them pretty. If you take the analogy of human body, the skeleton would be the HTML, skin would be the CSS and muscles that help us move would be JavaScript - we will learn more about JavaScript in the coming sections.

### Version Control Systems and Git

Version control systems allow you to track changes to your codebase/files over time. They allow you to go back to some previous version of the codebase without any issues. Also, they help in collaborating with people working on the same code – if you’ve ever collaborated with other people on a project, you might already know the frustration of copying and merging the changes from someone else into your codebase; version control systems allow you to get rid of this issue.
